# RCCar

This is the server which runs on Raspberry Pi 3 and it is responsible to respond to the actions from [RCController] (https://github.com/BILLyTheLiTTle/RCController) and apply these actions to the hardware. I decided to control the car using HTTP and any other communication protocol because I believe it is more expandable for more use cases and for not advanced users. It will be a good choice to control it remotely (far away from your location) using port forwarding in order to keep an eye to your house. It was never made to be a camera but it is still a Raspberry Pi on it and you can use it as you want.
